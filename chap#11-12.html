    <h2>Cloud Native Computing:</h2>
    <p>The Cloud Native Computing program prepares the students to program in open source
    technologies like, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native
    while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
    techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <section id="selection2"></section>
    <h2>Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
    <p>The artificial intelligence program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI
    technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like Python, Numpy, Pandas,
    Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and
    ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>
    <section id="selection3"></section>
    <h2>Blockchain:</h2>
    <p>The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains like Ethereum
    and Hyperledger (Fabric), and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on
    frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps
    (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-aservice (BaaS) and how to
    develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
    </p>
    <section id="selection4"></section>
    <h2>Internet of Things:</h2>
    <p>The Internet of things program introduces the students to open source development
    technologies like Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,
    and Kubernetes while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT
    Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
